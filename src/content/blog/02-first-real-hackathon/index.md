## My First Hackathon Experience at Royal Hackaway

On January 21, 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in my first hackathon, Royal Hackaway, an MLH Hackathon hosted by my university. This event was not just a test of my technical skills but also a chance to collaborate, innovate, and push the boundaries of what I thought was possible within a limited timeframe.

### The Event

Royal Hackaway brought together students from various disciplines, all eager to create something amazing over the course of 24 hours. The atmosphere was electric with creativity and the spirit of competition. The hackathon kicked off with an opening ceremony where we were introduced to the event's rules, resources, and mentors who would be available to guide us through the challenges we might face.

### The Project: CyberRunner

For the hackathon, my teammate and I decided to work on a project that we named **CyberRunner**. Despite facing the challenge of having several teammates leave early, we were determined to see our project through to completion.

CyberRunner is a fun and engaging platformer game built using Phaser.js. Here’s a brief overview of what we accomplished:

- **Game Concept**: Players control Robotic Percival, navigating through a cyber-themed world, collecting chips and avoiding bombs to score points.
- **Graphics**: We designed multi-layered backgrounds and smooth character animations to make the game visually appealing.
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: The game includes collectible chips that increase the score, avoidable bombs, and a game over screen with a restart functionality.

### Development Journey

The development process was both intense and exhilarating. Here’s a breakdown of our journey:

1. **Brainstorming**: We started with brainstorming sessions to decide on the game's concept and mechanics. Once we settled on the idea of a platformer game, we moved on to planning the features and gameplay flow.

2. **Setup and Coding**: We set up our development environment and began coding the basic framework of the game. Phaser.js, a powerful game development framework, was our tool of choice.

3. **Graphics and Animations**: Creating the graphics was one of the most enjoyable parts. We designed various background layers, character sprites, and game elements like chips and bombs.

4. **Gameplay Mechanics**: Implementing the gameplay mechanics was challenging yet rewarding. We focused on making the character movements smooth and responsive, and ensuring the collision detection worked seamlessly.

5. **Testing and Debugging**: Throughout the night, we tested our game rigorously, fixing bugs and refining the gameplay. This iterative process helped us polish the game and ensure it was fun to play.

### The Challenges

One of the biggest challenges we faced was the sudden departure of many of our teammates. This unexpected turn of events forced us to quickly adapt and redistribute the workload. Despite this, we managed to stay focused and committed to our project.

Another challenge was the time constraint. Building a fully functional game within 24 hours required us to prioritize features and manage our time efficiently. We had to make quick decisions and often rely on our instincts to move forward.

### The Outcome

By the end of the hackathon, we had a working prototype of CyberRunner. Although it was far from perfect, we were proud of what we had accomplished given the circumstances. Presenting our project to the judges and other participants was a thrilling experience, and receiving feedback was incredibly valuable.

### Reflections

Participating in Royal Hackaway was an unforgettable experience. It taught me the importance of teamwork, perseverance, and adaptability. I learned a lot about game development, problem-solving, and the value of pushing through challenges.

I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this hackathon and look forward to more such experiences in the future. This event has ignited a passion for hackathons, and I am excited to continue learning and creating in this vibrant community.
